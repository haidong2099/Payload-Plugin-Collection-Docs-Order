# Payload Plugin: Drag-to-Order Collections

A Payload CMS plugin that allows you to drag and reorder your collections directly in the Payload admin panel.

This plugin adds an easy-to-use feature for managing the order of collections. When you drag and drop items within the collection, it automatically updates an `Order Number` field for each collection, ensuring that the order is consistently reflected across the admin panel.

To use this plugin, youâ€™ll need:

* Basic knowledge of Payload CMS concepts.
* Some JavaScript/TypeScript experience.

## Background
